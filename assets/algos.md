method efficiency in big O

for loop is O(n)

.pop() is O(1) constant bc it is always taking off the last one.

math is constant

.shift() and unshift() is O(n) because it is completing one operation for each item in the array to move indices.

.sort() is nlogn --more to this

loop inside a loop is n \* n
